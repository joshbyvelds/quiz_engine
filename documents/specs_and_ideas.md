## Game Modes

#### Mode 1 - Learning Mode - #####

This mode is well allow the user to go through 30 questions at time

When a user answers a question and get it wrong, they will have a second chance to get it 
correct. if they get it wrong again they will be shown the correct answer and move on to the 
next question.

#### Mode 2 - Wrong Answer Improvement - #####

In this mode, we will take the top 30 questions the user has gotten wrong from all three modes the most and quiz them on
those questions. 


#### Mode 3 - Practice Mode - ####

The user will go though and answer every question they can, like a real test. only once the user clicks
finished at the bottom of the test will the answers be checked. Once the quiz is complete, show the 
results.
